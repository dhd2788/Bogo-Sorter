What this program does
======================
This program will run the bogo sort algorithm on lists of size 1 - N, where N is given by the user. The program then runs merge sort on a list with the same number of elements, and compares the running times. It prints out how long the sorting took (in seconds) as well as how many iterations it took.

How to use
==========
Run the file bogo.py. Input the value of N and press enter. After the program has completed the sorting, you may press enter again to close the program.
